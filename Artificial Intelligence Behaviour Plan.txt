Artificial Intelligence Behaviour Plan
======================================

1. Decision Making
Using a finite state machine
with behaviours and transitions

	Pros:
	Allows specific transitions between states
	
	Cons:
	With more behaviours the amount of transitions
	required becomes overly complicated
	
	Other Options:
	Behaviour trees
	Blackboards
	Planing
	
2. Pathfinding Technique
Using A* to find path 
and pass the path made of 
nodes to a behaviour which 
makes the game object follow

	Pros:
	Good for finding point a to b
	for an individual or small group
	of objects
	
	Cons:
	not as good for large groups of 
	objects moving to a point
	
	Other Options:
	Steering Behaviours and obstical avoidence
	Flow Fields
